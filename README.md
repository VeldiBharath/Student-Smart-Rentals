# Student Smart Rentals Ecommerce Website
 ## 1. Product Overview
- Motivated by the founder's own experience, the Rental & Services
Management System project seeks to streamline the moving-in process for
both in-state and overseas students.
- The concept fills in significant holes in the market for rental platforms by
concentrating on apartment rentals and related services. The system, which
was created especially for Indiana University of Bloomington students,
provides comprehensive property listings that include vital details like the
distance from supermarkets and campus amenities. Students no longer have
to visit various platforms during the housing hunt because to the
centralization of this data.
- Additionally, the initiative gives students access to multimedia elements,
map views, user evaluations, and other resources that help them make
educated decisions. It also makes it easier to acquire moving-in services like
utilities setup and transportation. Through features like messaging and chat,
the system fosters a sense of community, enhancing the overall experience
for international students during their crucial transition period.

## 2. System Requirements
- Operating Environment: The system must operate seamlessly in web
environments, catering to users accessing it from different devices and
platforms.
- Responsive Web Application: It's designed as a web application using
modern frameworks like React, with backend elements aligning with the
MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
- Database: MongoDB is used for storing data like apartment listings, user
profiles, and transactional data.
- Authentication and Security: Firebase is integrated for user authentication,
including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- Client-Side (Frontend): Developed using React, providing the user
interface for interacting with the application.
- Server-Side (Backend): Built with Node.js and Express.js, handling
requests and managing external authentication through Firebase.

## 3. Product Installation
- Initial Setup: The software is a web-based application, thus it does not
require a traditional installation process on a client machine. It is accessed
through a web browser.
- Dependencies: Ensure that the browser is up to date to support the latest
web technologies used in the application.
- Software Support Packages: For any backend setup or modification,
familiarity with the MERN stack is required. Installation of Node.js,
MongoDB, and other related technologies on the server-side may be
necessary.
- Python Dependency: If there is a Python dependency (not explicitly
mentioned in the documents), you can refer to Python's installation website
for detailed installation instructions.
